- [✅] Migration files for schema versioning
- [✅] SQLite configuration for development
- [✅] PostgreSQL configuration for production
- [✅] Database connection service with error handling

### Acceptance Criteria

- [✅] Web OTP verify endpoint (`POST /api/auth/web/verify-otp`)
- [✅] Android OTP request endpoint (`POST /api/auth/android/request-otp`)
- [✅] Android OTP verify endpoint (`POST /api/auth/android/verify-otp`)
- [✅] Bot authentication guard

**Status**: [✅] Completed  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

### Description

- [✅] Transfer validation (amount, phone format)
- [✅] User status verification before creation

### Acceptance Criteria
- Cannot create transfer to same recipient within 5 minutes ✅
- Transfers within 20 seconds get "delayed" status ✅
- Operator correctly detected from phone prefix ✅
- Invalid phone numbers rejected ✅
- Inactive users cannot create transfers ✅

- ✅ Amount validation: > 0, <= 100,000, must be integer
- ✅ 5-minute rule: checkSameRecipientRule() - hard block with BadRequestException
- ✅ 20-second rule: checkGlobalCooldown() + calculateExecutionTime() - sets status to 'delayed'
- ✅ Operator detection: detectOperator() uses operator_prefixes table
- ✅ Error messages in Arabic for better user experience
- ✅ BotService integrated with TransfersService for transfer submission
- ✅ getUserTransfers() and getUserStats() methods for UI endpoints
- ⏳ Business rule timeframes are hardcoded (5 min, 20 sec) - can be made configurable in future

- Completed jobs trigger bot notifications ⏳ (TODO)
- Stale "processing" jobs are handled (timeout) ✅
- Android receives clear job details (phone, amount, operator) ✅

### Notes
- ✅ upgradeDelayedTransfers() called before each polling request
- ✅ getNextPendingTransfer() uses Prisma transaction for atomic operation
- ✅ Pessimistic locking: changes status to 'processing' when claimed
- ✅ submitTransferResult() updates status to success/failed with carrier response
- ✅ Scheduled task (TasksService) runs every minute to handle stale transfers
- ✅ Stale transfers: processing status > 5 minutes → marked as failed
- ✅ System-wide statistics methods: getSystemStats(), getAllTransfers()

## Dependencies Between Tasks

- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (needs database)
- Task 3 depends on Task 2 (needs auth)
- Task 4 depends on Task 1, 2 (needs database and auth)
- Task 5 depends on Task 4 (needs transfer creation)
- Task 6 depends on Task 1, 2 (needs database and auth)
- Task 7 depends on Task 2, 4 (needs auth and transfers)
- Task 8 depends on Task 2, 4 (needs auth and transfers)
- Task 10 can be implemented in parallel but should be completed before production

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Repository Pattern on top of Prisma for better abstraction
- Modular Monolith approach with NestJS modules
- JWT for Web/Android, static token for Bot
- Database-driven business rules (no hardcoded values)

### Security Considerations
- All sensitive data (OTPs, tokens) must be hashed
- Phone numbers masked in logs
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- CORS restricted to known origins
- HTTPS only in production

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Caching for operator rules and statistics
- Pagination for all list endpoints
- Connection pooling for database

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business rules
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical flows (transfer creation)
- Performance tests for polling endpoints
